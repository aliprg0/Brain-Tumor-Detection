# Brain-Tumor-Detection

The Site Is A Example Of How An Simple AI Model Can Make Our Life Much More Easier. 

Be careful1! If you're using the project for an linux server, use "chabokan_deploy" branch and make the necessary changes for file addressing in code for yourself.

The main branch is such a simple example of the site. I was going to deploy the site to hereku but some stuff happend and it didn't work out(probably for the limited storage).
But "chabokan_deploy" is fully working in my server and feel free to use it for yourself.
